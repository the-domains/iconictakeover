In just a few short years,

MITXHELL

went from "Atlanta Street Hustler"
to

"Underground Wonder Boy of Hip Hop".

Upon entering the industry,

officially in 2013 With his Release of "Shape Shifter Mixtape".
Since then,

MITXHELL

has continued to amaze the masses
with his elegant aggressive tones,
and effortlessness lyricism.

While Collaborating on Projects w/:

• Waka Flocka Flame

• Young Scooter

• Royce Rizzy (RCA)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

...SHORTLY AFTER,

MITXHELL

found himself falling in love with the process of becoming great

!
This "Process",

would open him to a world beyond "RAP"

And what began as this expansion of material eventually evolved into the genre known as

Rock&Roll.

This transition caused all of the Music Industry to take notice.
Never before has an artist been able to embrace both,

Rap and Rock&Roll,

and-come across as believable as

MITXHELL

seems to be able to do.

Having the ability to capture the Heart of Nirvana,

and the ever so cool of Miles Davis.

..Its clear the that debonaire Mitxhell has come to

"Play-ball" - (A Track Released in early 2015)

but where could this come from?..

For that story we had to take trip down "MEMORY LANE",

and thats no pun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

MITXHELL

Born: Stephen Seth Mitchell

was a unique kid with contagious energy;
who seemed to have the innate
magnetic ability to attract people.
Consequently

MITXHELL

had many friends as a kid,
but unlike his family

MITXHELL

loved to spend time on

Moreland ave. in Jonesboro,GA

The attraction to "Rap&HipHop" was instant.
This is where a great deal

(If not all)

of his musical influences come from.

The talented young mogul with
Rock&Roll in his blood

and Hip Hop in his soul,

Has incredible story to sale;

While The anticipation of his industry debut release album titled:

------------------------------

"3-VI-ZERO"

-------------------------------------
his popularity is growing to the heights of

amazing yet opposite project release's such as:
"Nevermind" (Nirvana)

and

"The Black Album" (Jay-Z)

If these things hold to be true, then the artist known as

MITXHELL

has huge, but legendary shoes to feel.

Yet to see him in the studio element,

he clearly has a grasp on the responsibility he has to his craft.
